# Malware Behavior Analysis in a Controlled Kali Linux Environment

## Objective
The objective of this project was to safely analyze suspicious file behavior within a controlled virtual environment. This lab focused on identifying file characteristics, generating cryptographic hashes, and performing static analysis techniques commonly used by SOC and incident response analysts.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
- Linux command-line utilities (ls, file, sha256sum, strings)

## Environment
- Operating System: Kali Linux
- Environment Type: Isolated virtual machine
- Network Connectivity: Disabled during analysis

## Methodology
1. Created a controlled working directory for malware analysis.
2. Generated a simulated malware file using the EICAR antivirus test string.
3. Verified file existence and permissions using directory listing commands.
4. Identified file type using the `file` utility.
5. Generated a SHA-256 hash to uniquely identify the file.
6. Performed basic static inspection without executing the file.

## Observed Behavior
- The file was successfully created within the isolated environment.
- The file was identified as a test malware signature rather than a legitimate executable.
- A unique SHA-256 hash was generated for identification and tracking.
- No execution or active behavior was observed, as the file was not run.

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
| Type | Value | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| File Name | eicar_test.com | Simulated malware test file |
| SHA-256 Hash | (Captured in screenshots) | Unique file identifier |

## Security Implications
This exercise demonstrates how analysts safely handle suspicious files by performing identification and static analysis before any execution. Hashing allows files to be tracked across security tools such as SIEMs, EDR platforms, and threat intelligence feeds.

## Limitations
- The EICAR test file is not real malware and does not exhibit malicious runtime behavior.
- Dynamic analysis was intentionally avoided to maintain a safe environment.

## Lessons Learned
- Proper file handling and naming are critical during investigations.
- Hashing is a foundational step in malware triage and incident response.
- Analysts should prioritize safety and verification before execution.
